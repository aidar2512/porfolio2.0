However, for a live version, the files would need to be hosted on a web server or a platform like GitHub Pages. Assuming the repository is prepared:  
git clone https://github.com/aidar2512/portfolio2.0.git  

Replace aidar2512 with your actual GitHub username and portfolio2 with the repository name. Once cloned, the website can be run locally by opening the index.html file in any web browser.
